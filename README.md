Maze solver

The system build is using the breadth first search method to solve the maze and find the shortest path. It mainly uses FIFO known as queue to store unvisited nodes to discover in later iteration of the while loop.
To reconstruct the path, I used two arrays one to hold the parent node of a current node and the other to hold the actual path by extracting parent nodes from parent nodes array starting from the End point.
Steps
The program is very easy to use
1.	Press select file then navigate to the file you want to test make sure it follows the guidelines 
2.	Press on start

Please ignore the extra codes in form1.cs class I kept them there to show you my first attempts to solve the maze feel free to review them but they are not actually used in the current version.
The only functions that are being used in form1.cs  are the buttons and solveMaze().
There are proper comment across the code if you need any explanation do not hesitate to contact me.
